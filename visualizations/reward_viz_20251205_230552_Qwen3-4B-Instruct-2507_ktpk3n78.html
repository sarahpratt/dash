We want to find the sum of all such $n$ such that $n^3 - n$ is divisible by 24.\nWe have $n^3 - n = n(n^2 - 1) = n(n-1)(n+1) = (n-1)n(n+1)$.\nSince $n-1, n, n+1$ are three consecutive integers, their product is divisible by $3! = 6$.\nWe want to find $n$ such that $(n-1)n(n+1)$ is divisible by $24 = 2^3 \\cdot 3$.\nThis means that $(n-1)n(n+1)$ must be divisible by $2^3$ and $3$.\nSince $(n-1)n(n+1)$ is the product of three consecutive integers, it is always divisible by $3! = 6$.\nWe need to find when $(n-1)n(n+1)$ is divisible by $8$.\nSince $n-1, n, n+1$ are consecutive integers, at least one of them is divisible by 2.\nIf $n$ is even, then $n-1$ and $n+1$ are odd, so $(n-1)n(n+1)$ is divisible by 2.\nIf $n$ is odd, then $n-1$ and $n+1$ are even, so $(n-1)n(n+1)$ is divisible by 2.\nThus, $(n-1)n(n+1)$ is always divisible by 2.\n\nWe need $(n-1)n(n+1)$ to be divisible by $3$.\nSince $n-1, n, n+1$ are three consecutive integers, at least one of them is divisible by 3.\nThus, $(n-1)n(n+1)$ is divisible by 3.\nTherefore, $(n-1)n(n+1)$ is divisible by $2 \\cdot 3 = 6$.\nSince $(n-1)n(n+1)$ is divisible by 6, $(n-1)n(n+1)$ is divisible by 8.\n\nWe need $(n-1)n(n+1)$ to be divisible by $24 = 2^3 \\cdot 3$.\nSince $(n-1)n(n+1)$ is divisible by 6, we need $(n-1)n(n+1)$ to be divisible by 8.\nWe need $(n-1)n(n+1)$ to be divisible by $24$.\nWe need $(n-1)n(n+1)$ to be divisible by both 3 and 8.\nSince $(n-1)n(n+1)$ is always divisible by 6, we need it to be divisible by 8.\nWe need to find $n$ such that $(n-1)n(n+1)$ is divisible by 24.\n\nLet $n=1$. Then $n^3 - n = 1^3 - 1 = 0$, which is divisible by 24. But $n \\le 20$, so $n \\neq 1$.\nLet $n=2$. Then $n^3 - n = 2^3 - 2 = 8 - 2 = 6$, which is not divisible by 24.\nLet $n=3$. Then $n^3 - n = 3^3 - 3 = 27 - 3 = 24$, which is divisible by 24. So $n=3$ is a solution.\nLet $n=4$. Then $n^3 - n = 4^3 - 4 = 64 - 4 = 60$, which is not divisible by 24.\nLet $n=5$. Then $n^3 - n = 5^3 - 5 = 125 - 5 = 120$, which is not divisible by 24.\nLet $n=6$. Then $n^3 - n = 6^3 - 6 = 216 - 6 = 210$, which is not divisible by 24.\nLet $n=7$. Then $n^3 - n = 7^3 - 7 = 343 - 7 = 336 = 24 \\cdot 14$, so $n=7$ is a solution.\nLet $n=8$. Then $n^3 - n = 8^3 - 8 = 512 - 8 = 504 = 24 \\cdot 21$, so $n=8$ is a solution.\nLet $n=9$. Then $n^3 - n = 9^3 - 9 = 729 - 9 = 720$, which is not divisible by 24.\nLet $n=10$. Then $n^3 - n = 10^3 - 10 = 1000 - 10 = 990$, which is not divisible by 24.\n\nThe integers $n$ such that $n^3 - n$ is divisible by 24 are $n=3, 7, 8$.\nThe sum of these integers is $3 + 7 + 8 = 18$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{18}$", "is_final": true}], "student_a_model": "../../models/llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct", "student_b_model": "../../models/gemma/gemma-3-1b-it", "reward": 0.0, "extracted_a": "210", "extracted_b": "18", "extracted_key": "124", "answer_key_response": "I need to find all positive integers $n \\leq 20$ such that $24 \\mid n^3 - n$.\n\n## Setting Up the Problem\n\nFirst, I'll factor $n^3 - n$:\n$$n^3 - n = n(n^2 - 1) = n(n-1)(n+1) = (n-1)n(n+1)$$\n\nThis is the product of three consecutive integers.\n\n## Divisibility Requirements\n\nI need $(n-1)n(n+1)$ divisible by $24 = 8 \\times 3$.\n\n**Divisibility by 3:** Among any three consecutive integers, exactly one is divisible by 3.
